## SCRIPTS FOLDER README ##
###########################

This folder is basically the Assets folder for programmers
It is for general use scripts that don't fit elsewhere in the project and busses

A dedicated folder should be created for new mechanics and their scripts, scenes, etc.
If general use classes are made for a mechanic, those scripts should go in that folder

This folder is for general use classes that are not tied to a specific aspect of the game
An example of this kind of class would be the timer class from our previous project
Or any Bus that is initiated at the start of the game goes in here too

Per usual, if there get to be many files here, please put related ones in their own folders
