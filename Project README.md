This is the Game Project for the Pirate Software Game Jam January 2025

In general, different aspects of the game will have dedicated folders
for all the files related to that part of the game

For example, Player, System, UI, and World


We also have miscelaneous files to keep our extra pieces organized

These files are ones like Assets or Scripts where general use files go

Each major folder has a README for easy use
This definitely wasn't just so the folders would show up on the repo

If you don't know how something works or where something should go,
feel free to ping me (@Darredevyll (Daran)) or post in the group chat
